# Data Cleaning: Absenteeism Dataset

This project was completed as part of the **Data Analysis Bootcamp on Udemy**. It focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a dataset on employee absenteeism to make it ready for analysis and machine learning tasks.

## 📌 Objectives

- Drop irrelevant columns like unique IDs
- Convert categorical data (`Reason for Absence`) into grouped dummy variables
- Extract features from the `Date` column (Month and Day of the Week)
- Transform the `Education` column into a binary feature
- Ensure the final dataset is clean, consistent, and analysis-ready

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files

- `Absenteeism-data.csv` – Raw dataset
- `data_cleaning_project.ipynb` – Code and transformation steps
- `cleaned_Absenteeism-data` – Final cleaned dataset
- `README.md` – This file

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Real-world data often needs significant preprocessing
- How to use `get_dummies()` and feature engineering in Pandas
- Importance of cleaning for better model performance

## 🔗 Credits

Based on the instructions and guidance provided in the **Data Analysis Bootcamp (Udemy)**.
